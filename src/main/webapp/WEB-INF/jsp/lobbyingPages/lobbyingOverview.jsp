                        Why Lobbying is Important?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The practice of lobbying offers an opportunity for the resolution of disputes among often dissimilar and challenging points of view. Lobbying also disseminates information, analysis, and opinions to legislators and government leaders. This allows them to arrive at an informed and balanced decision.

                    <p>
                        Why Our Project Covers Lobbying Data?

                    	What is Campaign Finance?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Campaign finance refers to all funds raised to promote
                        candidates, political parties, or policy initiatives and referenda.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Campaign finance may be, arguably, the most important part of a political
                        campaign. Without funding, candidates can't travel, they can't advertise;
                        they are essentially unable to do - get in front of the people! During our
                        research, we found there to be a direct correlation between the popularity
                        of a candidate and the candidate's budget. This is an intuitive data point,
                        given candidates with larger budgets are able to hold larger events, visit
                        more places, and ultimately spend more time with voters.
                    </p>
					<h2>
						Campaign Finance and Geppetto
					</h2>
					<p>
						Campaigns are expensive and as the old saying goes, "Money Talks".
						Geppetto provides six different views of campaign contributions from individuals
						and political action committees (PAC). These views explore the number of donations
						to a candidate, the average donation amount, the amount of donations from a particular
						industry and more!
					</p>
					<p> 
						Use these views to better understand campaign budgets and how they impact campaigns.

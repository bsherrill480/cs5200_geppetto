                        Definition: Campaign finance refers to all funds raised to promote
                        candidates, political parties, or policy initiatives and referenda.

                        Campaign finance may be, arguably, the most important part of a political
                        campaign. Without funding, candidates can't travel, they can't advertise;
                        they are essentially unable to do - get in front of the people! During our
                        research, we found there to be a direct correlation between the popularity
                        of a candidate and the candidate's budget. This is an intuitive data point,
                        given candidates with larger budgets are able to hold larger events, visit
                        more places, and ultimately spend more time with voters.
